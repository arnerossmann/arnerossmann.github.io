# About me

I'm an enthuist CTO and Enterprise Architect for Big Data, Cloud, Analytics and the related topics. I love to learn new technologies and methods and play around with them. Apart from the technical perspective I'm interested in agile methodologies, coaching clients and teams on their journey towards agility and data-powered enterprises.

## Current research topics

Currently I'm researching on leveraging the [IDP](https://dataworldliving.com/post/2025-05-07_unlocking_innovation_with_platform_engineering/) approach for accelerating Data & AI value creation.
